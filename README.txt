LAKSHYA 2017EEB1149
CS533 TERM PROJECT

composition_final = the LogicProX project file showcased in the demo video

demo_video.mkv = demo_video showcasing the generated harmonies

generated_midi_final_sgd1.mid = the midi file generated from the best performing model instance during training. using SGD optimizer with learning rate = 1

lr_test_result_all.png and lr_test_result_all.svg = result for the learning rate experiment

midi/ = folder containing the midi files of harmony.mid, melody.mid and the LogicProX project used for data cleaning

Music_Harmonization_Using_Reinforcement_Learning.pdf = Term Paper

notebooks/ = folder containing copy of the google colab jupyter notebook instance whichwas used for all experimentations and implementations

trained_models/ = folder containing saved instance of different models tried out during experimentation
